### What I learned

This lesson helped me better understand the application of `display: grid`, particularly in comparison to `display: flex`.

### Continued development

I will continue to develop myself through the course and by taking on challenges from [FrontEndMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - 
I used W3Schools to clarify my doubts and I really liked their examples, which clarify how to use CSS properties.

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/) - I'd like you to get to know MDN Web Docs, which helped me a lot in understanding HTML tags.
